## WTF ?
SAPE is a poetry editor program, basicly a minimalistic text-editor with two main functions : 
1. Phonetic Syllable counter
2. Rhyme search

## Releases :
0.0.1 : https://github.com/caioluders/SAPE/releases/tag/0.0.1

### Phonetic Syllable counter
It counts the sum of the Phonetic Syllable of each line, helping the poet to adjust the metric of your poem. It's the number before each line.

### Rhyme search
It helps the poet to find words that rime with a desired word. Select the word and press go to "Edit->Rimes" ( Or cmd+R )

#### ETC
Right now only works with Brazilian Portuguese , and it uses the word database of dicionario-aberto.net .
